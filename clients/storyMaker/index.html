        <h1>Part-1 Plot</h1>
        <pre>
            
On the last day of college, 
<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> finally confesses his love to his classmate <chara id="Anjali">Anjali</chara>,
who rejects him.
After college, <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> plans to move to the UK for higher studies,
leaving all troubles behind, 
but his visa application gets rejected,
leaving him with one more chance to apply after six months.

Meanwhile, 
<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> is aimlessly living his life,
helping his father with deliveries from his bakery.
On one such delivery,
<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> meets his old friend <chara id="amal">amal</chara> Davis and
rekindles their friendship. 
            
While <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> is still contemplating what to do next,
<chara id="amal">amal</chara> suggests joining a GATE course in Hyderabad with him,
until <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> can apply again for a visa and
 also as a backup if the application fails.
<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> agrees to it and moves to Hyderabad with <chara id="amal">amal</chara>.

In Hyderabad, <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara>, a girl in her early twenties,
has just joined the development team of an IT company,
where a pompous man named <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> is the senior developer.

After joining, <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> moves in with her friend <chara id="Karthika">Karthika</chara> and
 another roommate Niharika to an apartment.
 <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> has a crush on <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara>,
 but he parades himself as her "bestie" (best friend).
 <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara> meet <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> and
 her team at a wedding,
 where the former are the groom's guests and
 the latter are the bride's guests.
 <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> falls for <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara>. 
They all strike a friendship during the wedding.
 Due to unexpected circumstances,
 <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> 
and <chara id="Karthika">Karthika</chara> choose to return to Hyderabad with <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara>.

<chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> is very comfortable with <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and
 finds his antics funny and friendly.
 <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> finds a job at a fast-food restaurant 
to stay in Hyderabad as he drops the GATE course and
 wants to find out more about <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara>. 

<chara id="amal">amal</chara> tries to hint to <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> about <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara>'s crush through <chara id="Karthika">Karthika</chara> at a pub,
 but she shoots him down saying <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> is looking for someone mature 
and accomplished and
 not someone like <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara>, 
who does not have a plan even for tomorrow.
 After a lot of soul searching, 
<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> decides to confess his love to <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara>, 
but she says she wants someone who is mature and settled in life.


<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> dejectedly decides to leave Hyderabad and
 move to Chennai with his friend from college. 

However, <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> also develops feelings towards <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara>,
 but she is unsure of them.
 She tries to convince him to come back, 
but <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> does not respond to her calls or messages.

            
After a couple of months, 
<chara id="Karthika">Karthika</chara> invites <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> to her engagement party in Hyderabad.
 <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> tries to talk to him, 
but <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> acts like he has moved on and 
informs her that his visa application has arrived and 
he is leaving for the UK the next day from Hyderabad.


<chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> accosts <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara> and demands to have a conversation with them.
 <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara>, both being very drunk, 
take the mickey out of <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara>, 
remarking that <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> will reject him as well.

 To prove <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara> wrong,
 <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> asks <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> in front of everyone at the party whether she loves him,
 and she brusquely replies 'no',
 sparking further taunts and horse laughs from <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara>.

 Humiliated by this, <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> vows to exact revenge on <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara>,
 and leaves the party. 

<chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> is still not interested in talking to <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> and sleeps at the party.


The next morning, <chara id="amal">amal</chara> and <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> leave for the airport and
 <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> joins them. 

En route, <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> and his goons ambush them,
 but <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> saves <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and <chara id="amal">amal</chara> by incapacitating <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> with the pepper spray 
that <chara id="aadhi">aadhi</chara> himself had given her and the other female staff in their office for self-defense.

 <chara id="reenu">reenu</chara> confesses her love to <chara id="sachin">sachin</chara> and
 says "From now on, we are in a long-distance relationship.

 Let's see how that goes" and bids farewell.
