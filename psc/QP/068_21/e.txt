Choose the correct answer and darken the bubble corresponding to the question number
using Blue or Black Ball Point Pen in the OMR Answer Sheet.
11. Each correct answer carries 1 mark and for each wrong answer 1/3 mark will be
deducted. No negative mark for unattended questions.
12. No candidate will be allowed to leave the examination hall till the end of the session and
without handing over his/her Answer Sheet to the Invigilator. Candidates should ensure
that the Invigilator has veriﬁed all the entries in the Register Number Coding Sheet and
that the Invigilator has afﬁxed his/her signature in the space provided.
13. Strict compliance of instructions is essential. Any malpractice or attempt to commit any
